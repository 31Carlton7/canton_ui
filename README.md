## Description

This includes things such as themes (colors, typography, etc.), custom methods, buttons, text-inputs, a color picker, and more. This all in attempt to limit the amount of time I spend on remaking simple tools and ui, while still customizing my screens to my flavor. Please note that this package will not be uploaded on pub.dev in the near future.

## Getting Started

To use this package and access its content, add this dependency to your pubspec.yaml

```
dependencies:
    canton_design_system:
        git:
          url: git://github.com/31Carlton7/canton_design_system.git
          ref: master
```

And simply import the package using this code

```
import 'package:canton_design_system/canton_design_system.dart';
```

BTW `package:flutter/material.dart` is already imported when using this package so no need to re-import :)
